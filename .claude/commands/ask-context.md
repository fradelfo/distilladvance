# Context gathering

Before I start working on this project, I need to understand the full context.

## Questions I need answered

### 1. Project documentation
- Where is the discovery report? (paste or point to file)
- Where is the PRD? (paste or point to file)
- Any existing design specs?
- Any technical constraints I should know?

### 2. Existing work
- Is there an existing codebase? Where?
- Any existing CLAUDE.md I should review?
- Agent definitions or command templates you've used before?
- Previous prompts that worked well?

### 3. Current state
- What's already built (MVP status)?
- What's the next feature/task?
- Any blockers or open decisions?

### 4. Preferences
- Tech stack preferences?
- Code style conventions?
- Testing approach?

## How to provide context

You can:
1. **Paste content directly** into the chat
2. **Point to files** and I'll read them
3. **Upload files** and I'll process them

## I will not proceed until I have

- [ ] Problem/goal clarity
- [ ] Target user understanding
- [ ] Technical constraints
- [ ] Current state of work
- [ ] What success looks like

**Please provide the relevant context now.** I'll summarise what I understand before starting any work.
