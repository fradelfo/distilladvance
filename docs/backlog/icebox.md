# Icebox

Ideas we're not doing now. Review quarterly.

## Parked

| Feature | Why parked | Revisit when |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| Multi-AI Provider Support | Anthropic Claude sufficient for MVP; adds complexity | Post-beta, if users request |
| Kubernetes Deployment | Docker Compose sufficient for current scale | 1000+ users or enterprise requirements |
| Redis Caching Layer | PostgreSQL performance adequate; premature optimization | When API latency becomes issue |
| Advanced Prompt Versioning | Last-edit-only works for MVP; full history adds complexity | User feedback indicates need |
| Team Analytics Dashboard | Individual analytics dashboard exists; team view is nice-to-have | Post-beta |
| ChromaDB Vector Storage | PostgreSQL cosine similarity works well for current scale | 10K+ prompts per workspace |
| Real-time Collaboration | Last-write-wins sufficient for MVP | User feedback indicates need |
| Native Desktop App | Web + extension covers use cases | Strong user demand |
| Mobile App | Responsive web adequate; capture happens on desktop | Usage patterns indicate need |
| Public Prompt Marketplace | Team-first focus; competitors serve this market | Strategic pivot decision |
| Slack/Notion Integrations | Core loop must be solid first | Post product-market fit |
| Prompt A/B Testing | Advanced feature; learn from usage first | Beta feedback |
| Custom Domains | Enterprise feature | Enterprise tier launch |
| Webhook/API Access | Developer feature | Developer tier launch |
