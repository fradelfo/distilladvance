## Usage Patterns

### Single Agent Usage
```bash
# Use specific agent for focused tasks
"Use the frontend-specialist agent to review this React component"
```

### Multi-Agent Workflows
```bash
# Coordinate multiple agents
"Have the business-analyst gather requirements, then the backend-specialist design the API, and the test-engineer create test cases"
```

### Automatic Selection
Agents are automatically selected based on file types, keywords, and task context when properly configured.

## Customization

Each template includes:
- Specialized system prompt
- Tool restrictions
- Domain-specific instructions
- Example use cases
- Integration guidelines

Copy and modify templates to create organization-specific agents.
